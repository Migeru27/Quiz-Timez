# Quiz Timez
A quiz meant to excerise your brain

## About

A simple quiz to test your skills and be able to answer them in a timely manner to get the highest score. A leaderboard meant to help motivate you to remember the material while also being quick to answer them.


## Motivation ðŸ’¡

I wanted to create a simple quiz page that can easily be converted into any other knowledge based quiz. The source code is there to modify the questions and answers so it can be changed with other sets of questions and answers as they please. In the main source code, I used CS concepts since this is simple knowledge that can be used to test my knowledge on our current topics

## Tools
